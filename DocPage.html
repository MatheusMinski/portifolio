                    The Void grows, and the Void adapts—in none of its myriad spawn are these truths more apparent than
                    Kha'Zix. Evolution drives the core of this mutating horror, born to survive and to slay the strong.
                    Where it struggles to do so, it grows new, more effective ways to counter and kill its prey.
                    Initially a
                    mindless beast, Kha'Zix's intelligence has developed as much as its form. Now, the creature plans
                    out
                    its hunts, and even utilizes the visceral terror it engenders in its victims.

                    interactions
                    with Isolated targets. When Kha'Zix is not visible to the enemy team, he gains Unseen Threat,
                    causing
                    his next basic attack against an enemy champion to deal bonus magic damage and slow them for a

                    Claws, this refunds a percent of it's cooldown against Isolated targets. Kha'Zix also gains

                    also
                    within the explosion radius. If he chooses to Evolve Spike Racks, Void Spike now fires three spikes
                    in a
                    cone, slow enemies hit, and reveals enemy champions hit for 2 seconds. Isolated targets are slowed

                    range increases by 200 and the cooldown resets on champion kill or assist.

                <p>Each rank allows Kha'Zix to evolve one of his abilities, giving it a unique additional effect. When
                    activated, Kha'Zix becomes Invisible, triggering Unseen Threat and increasing Movement Speed. If he
                    chooses to Evolve Adaptive Cloaking, Void Assault gains increased Invisibility duration, and an
                    additional use.

                    Utterly ruthless and without mercy, Zed is the leader of the Order of Shadow, an organization he
                    created
                    with the intent of militarizing Ionia's magical and martial traditions to drive out Noxian invaders.
                    During the war, desperation led him to unlock the secret shadow form—a malevolent spirit magic as
                    dangerous and corrupting as it is powerful. Zed has mastered all of these forbidden techniques to
                    destroy anything he sees as a threat to his nation, or his new order.

                <p>
                    A master of Ionia's ancient martial arts, Lee Sin is a principled fighter who channels the essence
                    of
                    the dragon spirit to face any challenge. Though he lost his sight many years ago, the warrior-monk
                    has
                    devoted his life to protecting his homeland against any who would dare upset its sacred balance.
                    Enemies
                    who underestimate his meditative demeanor will endure his fabled burning fists and blazing
                    roundhouse
                    kicks.

                <p>Sonic Wave: Lee Sin projects a discordant wave of sound to locate his enemies, dealing physical
                    damage to
                    the first enemy it encounters. If Sonic Wave hits, Lee Sin can cast Resonating Strike for the next 3
                    seconds. Resonating Strike: Lee Sin dashes to the enemy hit by Sonic Wave, dealing physical damage
                    based
                    on the target's missing Health.

                <p>Safeguard: Lee Sin rushes to target ally, shielding himself from damage. If the ally is a champion,
                    they
                    are also shielded. After using Safeguard, Lee Sin can cast Iron Will for the next 3 seconds. Iron
                    Will:
                    Lee Sin's intense training allows him to thrive in battle. For 4 seconds, Lee Sin gains Life Steal
                    and
                    Spell Vamp.

                <h5>TEMPEST / CRIPPLE</h5>
                <p>Tempest: Lee Sin smashes the ground, sending out a shockwave that deals magic damage and reveals
                    enemy
                    units hit. If Tempest hits an enemy, Lee Sin can cast cripple for the next 3 seconds. Cripple: Lee
                    Sin
                    cripples nearby enemies damaged by Tempest, reducing their Movement Speed for 4 seconds. Movement
                    Speed
                    recovers gradually over the duration.</p>

                <h5>DRAGON'S RAGE</h5>
                <p>Lee Sin performs a powerful roundhouse kick launching his target back, dealing physical damage to the
                    target and any enemies they collide with. Enemies the target collides with are knocked into the air
                    for
                    a short duration. This technique was taught to him by Jesse Perring, although Lee Sin does not kick
                    players off the map.
